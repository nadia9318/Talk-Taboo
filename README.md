## **Inspiration**
When we got together as a team, we began sharing our whys (why this hackathon?) and in doing so, we shared personal stories and struggles. We realized there were many topics we women are not given space in our society to openly and vulnerably discuss because they are stigmatized. We also realized women do not have access to a central platform where people/women of color experiencing issues related to sexual and reproductive health can communicate and easily access relevant and reliable information. It felt great to connect with other women and do just that, in an environment we felt held and seen in and could share our experiences without shame or condemnation. With this realization, we began to brainstorm how we could provide this safe space along with reliable resources (e.g, psychoeducation, expert advice) while using AI to create an engaging and customizable community. Of all the topics we discussed, we decided to narrow down our focus around women's sexual and reproductive health. 

## **What it does**
Talk Taboo is an AI-powered platform centered on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) for all women*, particularly women of color. We leverage and humanize our users' experience of AI via our friendly AI, Tabi. Tabi uses OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo and a custom GPT builder that is configured with custom instructions for legitimacy of information, a personalized knowledge base for cultural diversity, and specialized AI capabilities for improving user experience.  

With Tabi, our platform aims to create a single hub for the latest accurate and reliable information on SRH which:
1. Drastically minimizes the overwhelm of sifting through the internet for trustworthy information. 
2. Educates our users with a diverse set of information from reputable sources reflective of their experiences in a centralized resource hub.
3. Provides community forums in which women can connect and discuss all topics (nothing's off the table! Or *taboo*, if you will). 

*_We acknowledge there are persons who have female sexual reproductive organs but do not identify as a woman, and vice versa. This platform is meant for you too. To avoid redundancy, we will use “woman” as the term meant for the majority of the population who has female sexual reproductive organs and identify as “woman”._

## **Challenges we ran into**
1. We had so many causes we were passionate about it was challenging to narrow down where to place our focus
2. Building a digital product that uses a specific form of technology
3. So many products already exist that address so many issues! Inspiring and also a challenge as we think about what we want to specifically contribute to this space
4. While writing the survey asking how people identify (woman, female) was a bit of a challenge as this to has implicit complexities.
5. Learning how to code a full stack project. As well as learning new coding languages like React and Python and new tech (ai).
6. Connecting the ai to the backend then to the frontend. And not being able to finish the code because of such.


## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
- We are proud our teammates effort and passion to bring this project together from ideation to demo.
- Creating beautiful designs and workflow of the product.

## **What's next for Talk Taboo**
Future scope for Talk Taboo looks bright and promising. To start, we plan on adding more customizable features that will allow users to chose if they want resources to cater them by pinpointing information based on racial/ethic identity. We also want to be able to incorporate activism within the platform where the community can come together and stand by causes they believe in.
